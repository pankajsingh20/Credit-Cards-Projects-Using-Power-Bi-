Project- Credit Card Report

Objective
Develop a dynamic weekly credit card dashboard that delivers real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, empowering stakeholders to effectively monitor and analyze credit card operations.

Procedure

Step 1: Importing Data from SQL Database
•	Imported transaction and customer data from SQL database into the working environment.
•	Connected to the SQL database, queried necessary tables, and exported data into CSV format for further processing.

Step 2: Data Cleaning and Standardization
•	Removing Duplicates: Used Excel and SQL queries to eliminate duplicate records, ensuring unique transactions.
•	Correcting Inconsistencies: Standardized data entries using Excel's conditional formatting and functions.
•	Standardizing Date Formats: Ensured consistent date formats (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD) for accurate time series analysis.
•	Correcting Data Types: Verified and corrected data types for fields (e.g., numerical values and dates).

Step 3: Utilizing DAX Functions for Data Analysis
•	SWITCH Function: Categorized transactions based on amount.
•	CALCULATE Function: Performed calculations based on specific filters.
•	WEEKNUM Function: Extracted week numbers for weekly analysis.
•	NAME Function: Standardized customer names.

Step 4: Building an Interactive Power BI Dashboard
•	Imported cleaned data into Power BI, established table relationships, and designed visualizations (e.g., line charts for trends, bar charts for category-wise transactions).
•	Added interactive elements like slicers and filters for dynamic data exploration.
•	Developed a user-friendly dashboard layout with clear labels and intuitive navigation.

Step 5: Sharing Insights with Stakeholders
•	Published the Power BI dashboard to the Power BI service and set up access permissions.
•	Conducted presentations to walk stakeholders through the dashboard, highlighting key findings.
•	Created comprehensive documentation detailing the data cleaning process, analysis methods, and key insights.

Tools Used
•	Excel: For data cleaning and conversion to CSV.
•	SQL Workbench: For data extraction and querying.
•	Power BI: For advanced data visualization, DAX-based analysis, and dashboard creation.

Conclusion
This project successfully developed a dynamic weekly credit card dashboard that provided real-time insights into key performance metrics. The dashboard empowered stakeholders with actionable insights, facilitating data-driven decision-making and operational efficiency.
